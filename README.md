# Quadruped-Gait-Evolution
This project uses an evolutionary model i.e. it tries to attain a suitable gait by the method of trial and error. 
Beginning with a randomly generated initial individual, the robot's genome changes under evolutionary pressures, allowing the quadruped to move effectively. 
After each iteration, the fitness of the quadruped is calculated by the fitness calculator using distance formula. 
Over time, fitness of the new individuals increases, leading to more effective gait.
